# Prog1-HW8

---

Write a program to tackle the following problems. All programming should use good function and variable names and sufficient comments for improved readability.

In **triangles.py**, define a Triangle class that contains 3 Points (from class/PPP 11) named p1, p2, and p3. The class must be called Triangle and have an \_\_init\_\_() function defined that takes in 3 Points as parameters. The 3 Points must be stored as p1, p2, and p3 in the class.

Included are the definition of the Point class and the input_Point() function from PPP 11, as well as an input_Triangle() function. Create functions that compute the following quantities. Show that they work by inputting the necessary triangles and outputting the results (descriptively).

- Write a function that takes in a Triangle and computes its perimeter. *The distance between two points from PPP 11 will be helpful.*
- Write a function that takes in a Triangle and computes its area using [Heron's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula). *Again, distance between two points from PPP 11 will be helpful, and you might use the perimeter function as well.*
- Write a function that takes in a Triangle and returns the centroid (the coordinates of the centroid are the average of the coordinates of the vertices).

***Bonus***
- Write a function that takes in a Triangle and returns True if it is a right triangle, False otherwise. *You might find the bonus from PPP 11 helpful here.*
- Write a function that takes in a Triangle and returns True if it is a nondegenerate triangle, False [otherwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#Triangle). *There are many paths to this -- distances, areas, and angle measures could all be useful strategies.*
